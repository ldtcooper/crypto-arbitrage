# The Problem
Getting into cryptocurrency daytrading starting out pretty rough? Wondering how to make a profit by buying and selling crypto? The best way to do this, with the appropriate hardware, is to do arbitrage. Arbitrage is when you buy an asset at a certain price in one marketplace and sell it for a profit in another marketplace. The goal of our app is to display opportunities for arbitrage by compiling different prices from different cryptocurrency marketplaces.

# The Data Solution
This project will clearly involve data management to scrape, clean, store, and retrieve the data from the cryptocurrency marketplaces. It is important since it may make cryptocurrency marketplaces even more accessible and thus provide easier usage to people who are trying to learn about crypto.

# The Basic Features
We plan to create a user portal in which you can search/add the currencies you wish to look at and compare, then we display the various prices and some statistics from each marketplace for each cryptocurrency selected. Additionally, we will have live scraping so that the data can be updated regularly, so you see the various arbitrage opportunities throughout the day. Thus the four basic features will be:

  1. Create database with user view for different cryptocurrency marketplaces
  2. Scrape and update database, hopefully at least once per hour
  3. Display cryptocurrencies in each marketplace to see current arbitrage opportunities and various important statistics
  4. Display historical data on each cryptocurrency using previous datapoints

# The Stretch Goals/Bonus Features
To improve our project further, we want to make:

  1. User accounts
  2. Saving persistent watchlists
  3. Benchmarking historical displays with indices (S&P, risk-free rate like T-bonds)
  4. Scrape and display news articles pertaining crypto/finance
